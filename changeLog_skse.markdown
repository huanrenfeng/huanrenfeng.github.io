Huan's First SKSE plugin!

You might wonder what was Huan doing these days. Here it is! I present to you my first SKSE plugin attempt! Watch the video to see what's new!



The plugin adds a new command called "huanTestFunc1". Once triggered, a UI will pop up.

It shows your fps currently. But I plan to implement more stuff here, to make it like a "native trainer" like the one in GTA. Cheers!



Copy the dll to Data\SKSE\Plugins and you are good to go!

(It might contradict with ENB. but I don't know.)

(It's LE plugin for now)
