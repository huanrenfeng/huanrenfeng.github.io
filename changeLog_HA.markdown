## Huan's Adventures Changelog

## **Huan's Adventure 0.1354** (10-15-2020)

<img src="/myassets/img/ha_0.1354_log_pic1.png" alt="ha_0.1354_log_pic1" style="zoom:33%;" />

Brawl, dance, drinking scooma, making out, BL, and masturbation are all implemented.

You need to run FNIS again.

## 0.1353:(10/10/2020)

Remake the cowboy hat, new mesh and texture; Now it comes with a hairdo, which solves the clipping problem entirely.

## 0.1352: (9/29/2020):

1.   Remake the cowboy hat; Improve MCM and show your genre. 
2.   Add a new keypoint after the trail;
3.   Fixed a bug that sex with Aeri got inverted;
4.   Fixed a bug when you ask Danica to get a Azura massage.

###### 0.1351: fix some typo and careless omission of some file.



## 0.1350 FOMOD Installer (9/16/2020)

1. Move all files inside the new fomod pack.

    You can choose "High/Low Resolution Texture", TwinPlugin, VoiceFiles, Mod Genre in the installation step.

   
   
   ​	(Genre_WesternAmerica would make you wear cowboy hat, Genre_vanilla doesn't)
   
   ​	( I plan on making new things for new genres, welcome to share your ideas)

2. Remove Huan's Animation Pack dependency and MuST dependency. Need to run FNIS again.

3. Fixed a bug that Aeri couldn't sleep at the bedroll. Add a new toggle for the function panel in MCM.

## 0.1340 Logic Pack (9/8/2020)

1. Remake the Bar Scene, now there's no jumping mini game. Instead there will be many different interactions with bar people, like
    drugs, making out, brawl and dance. (Not fully implemented, but you'll get the idea.). The more people there, the more interaction
    types you can have.    
2. Cancel the not user-friendly jump trigger at the horse scene to continue the scene.

3. Add a new keypoint at the Bannermare to load at the MCM, which allows you to replay the bar scene and continue from there.

4. In the farmer scene, it might contradict with the Companion Quest's Giant Attack quest. I nailed it by killing the giant through script.

5. Edit some incoherent dialogues. Add a new dialogue to Danica expaining why it's called "Azura Massage".

6. Make the massage available at anytime after the story3 is finished.( not tested)

## 0.1330 logicPack(9/2/2020) :

Add an MCM menu where you can have an option to jump to a certain story point directly. 

Fixed a bug that the Farmer is not moving.



## 0.1322 logicPack(8/4/2020) 

Make some more changes to the logic, now the Aeri not moving bug should be fixed. 

Some other tinkering.

## 0.131 logicPack (8/1/2020) 

Fix a dialogue bug. Make the cow scene optional.

## 0.130 Logic Pack (07/31/2020)

Complete the 3rd story. There should be a new animation pack and an art patch in the future.

But you can play now. I wrote some promt in the game where the custom animations should be implemented.

And you'll see a messagebox if the story completes.

There are some branches haven't been implemented yet. And some branches have been implemented. So you need to think before you choose any options in the game.

## 0.123

voicePack: fix voice file issue in 0.111 pack that lip file not generated; Add new voices; delete 0.111 voice pack.

logicPack: fix a bug that if Aeri loses, the scene won't proceed normally. Minor tinkering.

## 0.122 (07/25/2020)

logicPack: support new music and sound effect; minor tinkering with the scene; remove some unused change using xEdit.

art Patch 0.122: add new music track and a sound effect.

## 0.121 (07/23/2020)

logicPack: support new massage animation in Huan's AnimationPack 0.27 ; removed 0.111 logicPack

artPatch 0.120: new cut scene. 



## 0.12 (07/22/2020)

**Logic Pack:**



1. Advance the story, current story stops after you get dressed at the temple. Better save the game in the temple.. 
2. add soft dependency on ZazAnimationPack, if you have this installed, you'll have better play experience.
3. Fix naked Aeri's Neck Gap and Weight problem  .
4. Minor tinkering at several parts in previous scenes.

 

Animations (As new version of Huan's Animation Pack), a new cutscene , some music( As artPatch ) and voice (As voice Pack) will be released in the next few days.

 

(I didn't delete 0.111 logicPack, so if you are new to the mod, and want stability, you could try 0.111 first, then uninstall 0.111 logic pack and install 0.12 logic pack to experience new content. )

 

Because I didn't update the animation pack for now, when massaging, Balgruf, Danica and player will act weird.

 

(small new update on Logic pack, without increasing version number: fix a bug that danica will stand on the altar forever)

## 0.111 (07/16/2020)

art update:

     Contains two more music for the quest

logic pack and voice pack update:

     Add new voices for the quest; Fix a bug in 0.11 that if you don't rub Aeri's butt the scene won't continue.



In another examination, I found some issues in the packs.



1. skin texture issue on SE, making Aeri looks less pretty

2. artPacks for both LE and SE are still containing the voice files.

 

So I decided to repack again.

This time there's no patch again. install artPack and logic Pack and you are good to go.

In another test, I found that the logic pack and twinPlugin of HA can be used on both LE and SE.

## 0.11 (07/15/2020)

art patch: Contains some new meshes that 0.11 requires. It's a patch, install it with the artPack 0.101.

logic pack: Complete the second story. Please save right after you get the payment from the farmer. Require Huan's Animation Pack 0.26

## 0.104 logicpack

Add a prompt to tell you how to wear the outfit

Remove the hotfix for goat showing up because it's not necessary.

Aso uploaded the SE pack

## 0.103 new logicPack. 

**(Note: pack is a whole pack, not a patch, so you just uninstall the last logic pack and install the new one. )**

A Hotfix in function panel for making JumpAtBar off the journal.
A Hotfix in function panel to force the goat to show up
Improve the severios's standing position at the farm house and Aeri and Danica's position at the temple
Improve SexLab scenes.

## **0.102** **(7/12/2020)**

**new logicPack and twinPlugin: fix sleeping bug and mounting bug when twinPlugin is enabled.**

## **0.101 (7/11/2020)**

Repack the mod again. Fix the "No Dialogue with Aeri" bug.

Make a "HotFix" button in the function panel. If you are in the jump scene and can not continue, open the function panel and click the HotFix.

This time the mod is packed in 3 packs, art pack, voice pack and logic pack. Art pack contains meshes, textures, musics etc. Logic pack contains esp file, scripts and seq file.

**Contains "HotFix"es for "Jump at bar" scene, "Farmer not moving" issue and "first scene not running" issue. use the function panel and click HotFix to fix your issues. (hotfix for "First scene not running" is not tested by Huan, because Huan didn't get this issue)**

## **0.10**

Advance the story, the story stops at the end of the bath. **requires Huans Animation Pack 0.25**

## **0.09_twinPatch (7/10/2020)**

Make Aeri Look exactly Like you! using the methodology of [Doppelganger Follower](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6771-doppelganger-follower/)

## **0.09 ( 7/8/2020)**

Requires Huan's Animation Pack **0.24**

Advance the story a bit. Ends at holding Aeri. Patches that advance story will not be SE compatible.

Enhance the gameplay of the goat scene. When you hit the goat, the goat will fly (and bleat), making it much easiler to get it to the farmer. (Need to load a save before Aeri found the goat.)

## **0.087**

  repack the mod again. Fix the CTD issue caused by the hat mesh by remeshing it. (It's very time consuming to pack, repack and debug mod for both LE and SE version again and again. If there's no support for me I'll    stop testing and packing mod for SE for a while )

##### **0.087 voicePatch**: 

some voices requires future version to work. Wait for the next update.

## 0.086 patch

Fix the issue that it won't detect the horse mount. The patch works for both LE and SE.

I found that in the shepherd scene, the cowboy Hat mesh causes the game getting CTD randomly when playing or loading the save. I'm fixing it.

## **0.085 (7/7/2020)**

 

Fix1: as far as I know, the reason why the quest won't start automatically could be that another event in another mod got triggered which configured by that mod's modder to be preventing other mod to be triggered.
  So I just add another dialogue to Aeri to let you start the quest manualy if you got the issue. If you still couldn't get the quest started, see a relevant post in support.

Fix2: fix the bug that "It's a nice day" line show up in every NPC's dialogue.



Fix3: when in the shepherd scene, if you save the game and reload it, Aeri and her horse will float in the air. It is a bug in the mod MuST which can't handle things when reload on mount. update MuST to 0.261 or disable MuST to fix this. I also forfeit the "ride ahead" feature in the scene because it's still in debugging state and too dangerours to be played in the actual game. 

 

Fix4: fix bugs when you could accidentally quit a dialogue before unable to access the dialogue again.

 

Other improvement: make bedroll disappear after awake. Minor tinkering on every detail in the mod.

 

Tips: if you think the shepherd minigame is too hard, dismount and skip the scene using function panel.

This time, please save before you enter the ranch house 

Because of the amount of the tinkering, the mod got repacked again with voice files stripped. Seperate voice pack will be provided soon containing voices for newest dialogues. If you had any issues before, please replay the mod.

 

I spend 12 hours to fix all the bugs. 
 

In another test, I found we need seq file now. Please put the seq file in Data/Seq. ( it seems that only SE users should need this . )

 

In another test, I found SE version got an issue that it won't detect the horse mount, debugging.

## **0.08 (7/5/2020)**

advance the story. Require Huan's Animation Pack **0.23**. The story stops at farm house. 

 

( Do not use save files where you played v0.07. Use save file from 0.06 and replay the next story. Unless I said the version complete the next story, you need to load save file where last story ends. )

( try to jump to wear the hat)

## **0.07 (7/3/2020)**

advance to the next story. Require MuST 0.26 or higher version. The story stops at horse back.
