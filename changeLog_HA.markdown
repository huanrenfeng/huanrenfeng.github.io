## Huan's Adventures Changelog

## **Huan's Adventure 0.1354** (10-15-2020)

HA 0.1354 is  be released

Brawl, dance, drinking scooma, making out, BL, and masturbation are all implemented.

You need to run FNIS again.

## 0.1353:(10/10/2020)

 remake the cowboy hat, new mesh and texture; now it comes with a hair, which solves the clipping problem entirely.

## 0.1352: (9/29/2020):

1.   Remake the cowboy hat; Improve MCM and show your genre. 
2.   Add a new keypoint after the trail;
3.   Fixed a bug that sex with Aeri got inverted;
4.   Fixed a bug when you ask Danica to get a Azura massage.

###### 0.1351: fix some typo and careless omission of some file.



## 0.1350 FOMOD Installer (9/16/2020)

1. Move all files inside the new fomod pack.

    You can choose "High/Low Resolution Texture", TwinPlugin, VoiceFiles, Mod Genre in the installation step.

   
   
   ​	(Genre_WesternAmerica would make you wear cowboy hat, Genre_vanilla doesn't)
   
   ​	( I plan on making new things for new genres, welcome to share your ideas)

2. Remove Huan's Animation Pack dependency and MuST dependency. Need to run FNIS again.

3. Fixed a bug that Aeri couldn't sleep at the bedroll. Add a new toggle for the function panel in MCM.

## 0.1340 Logic Pack (9/8/2020)

1. Remake the Bar Scene, now there's no jumping mini game. Instead there will be many different interactions with bar people, like
    drugs, making out, brawl and dance. (Not fully implemented, but you'll get the idea.). The more people there, the more interaction
    types you can have.    
2. Cancel the not user-friendly jump trigger at the horse scene to continue the scene.

3. Add a new keypoint at the Bannermare to load at the MCM, which allows you to replay the bar scene and continue from there.

4. In the farmer scene, it might contradict with the Companion Quest's Giant Attack quest. I nailed it by killing the giant through script.

5. Edit some incoherent dialogues. Add a new dialogue to Danica expaining why it's called "Azura Massage".

6. Make the massage available at anytime after the story3 is finished.( not tested)

## 0.1330 logicPack(9/2/2020) :

Add an MCM menu where you can have an option to jump to a certain story point directly. 

Fixed a bug that the Farmer is not moving.



## 0.1322 logicPack(8/4/2020) 

Make some more changes to the logic, now the Aeri not moving bug should be fixed. 

Some other tinkering.

##### 0.1321

logicPack: Fix the Aeri sex postion reverse issue when twinPlugin is on. 

## 0.132  logicPack (8/2/2020)



​	Fix a bug when sleeping with Aeri. Add a new hot fix for Aeri not moving at the farm house.

## 0.131 logicPack (8/1/2020) 

Fix a dialogue bug. Make the cow scene optional.

## 0.130 Logic Pack (07/31/2020)

Complete the 3rd story. There should be a new animation pack and an art patch in the future.

But you can play now. I wrote some promt in the game where the custom animations should be implemented.

And you'll see a messagebox if the story completes.

There are some branches haven't been implemented yet. And some branches have been implemented. So you need to think before you choose any options in the game.

## 0.123

voicePack: fix voice file issue in 0.111 pack that lip file not generated; Add new voices; delete 0.111 voice pack.

logicPack: fix a bug that if Aeri loses, the scene won't proceed normally. Minor tinkering.

## 0.122 (07/25/2020)

logicPack: support new music and sound effect; minor tinkering with the scene; remove some unused change using xEdit.

art Patch 0.122: add new music track and a sound effect.

## 0.121 (07/23/2020)

logicPack: support new massage animation in Huan's AnimationPack 0.27 ; removed 0.111 logicPack

artPatch 0.120: new cut scene. 



## 0.12 (07/22/2020)

**Logic Pack:**



1. Advance the story, current story stops after you get dressed at the temple. Better save the game in the temple.. 
2. add soft dependency on ZazAnimationPack, if you have this installed, you'll have better play experience.
3. Fix naked Aeri's Neck Gap and Weight problem  .
4. Minor tinkering at several parts in previous scenes.

 

Animations (As new version of Huan's Animation Pack), a new cutscene , some music( As artPatch ) and voice (As voice Pack) will be released in the next few days.

 

(I didn't delete 0.111 logicPack, so if you are new to the mod, and want stability, you could try 0.111 first, then uninstall 0.111 logic pack and install 0.12 logic pack to experience new content. )

 

Because I didn't update the animation pack for now, when massaging, Balgruf, Danica and player will act weird.

 

(small new update on Logic pack, without increasing version number: fix a bug that danica will stand on the altar forever)

## 0.111 (07/16/2020)

art update:

     Contains two more music for the quest

logic pack and voice pack update:

     Add new voices for the quest; Fix a bug in 0.11 that if you don't rub Aeri's butt the scene won't continue.



In another examination, I found some issues in the packs.



1. skin texture issue on SE, making Aeri looks less pretty

2. artPacks for both LE and SE are still containing the voice files.

 

So I decided to repack again.

This time there's no patch again. install artPack and logic Pack and you are good to go.

In another test, I found that the logic pack and twinPlugin of HA can be used on both LE and SE.
