I tried living in park, when the temperature outside is not that hot or when there's a breeze.

I bought a foldable chair. And I can use the bench as a table, for me using my laptop.

When sleeping in the park, the position matters. I often feel some bird shit or some branches falling off the trees. And when it's night it's often got stronger winds, the sounds comming from the leaves are noisy. What's fatal is that you never know if there will be rain or not. Well I can set up a tent in the part but it's too obvious. I don't want to draw any attention.

I wish I can have a cave to live in.
