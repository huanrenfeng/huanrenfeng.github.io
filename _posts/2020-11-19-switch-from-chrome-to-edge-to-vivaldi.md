## Switch from Chrome to Edge, reason:

- Edge seems to be quicker.

## Switch from Edge to Vivaldi, several reasons:

1. It flashes from white to black every time I activte the window. (I have Dark Reader installed but it works well in Vivaldi). My eyes are too fragile to bear this.
2. It don't have a seperate search bar like Vivaldi. I often want to search the same words in different search engines to get better results. Vivaldi can make this faster.
3. Vivaldi can't press tab in the address bar to search, but it has a nickname feature. Just press g and a space bar and then you can search in google. It's much quicker than tab.

## Vivaldi Use Experience

I find it a greate browser, and perhaps the best browser.

- It support Chrome plugins.
- The settings window is great and I can find it right at the bottom left corner or press Ctrl+F12.

## Disadvantage

- I find no direct UI way to import password and bookmarks from the new Chromium based edge.

  But I did find [this link](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/23989/export-import-passwords-via-csv-vivaldi-1-13-1-14/7) that tells us that we can use a chrome's specific setting url to achieve import passwords through csv.

  Bookmakrs are ok because I don't quite rely on it. I can remember most website urls that I use frequently. And I record other urls in my diary.

  

- No IOS app. Meaning that I can't sync my data on my iPhone. 

## All of these browsers compared to Firefox

Firefox has a quite advanced web proxy setting feature.
