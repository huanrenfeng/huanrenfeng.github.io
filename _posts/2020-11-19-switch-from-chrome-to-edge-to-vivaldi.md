## Switch from Chrome to Edge, reason:

- Edge seems to be quicker.

## Switch from Edge to Vivaldi, several reasons:

1. It flashes from white to black every time I activte the window, also when starting the app ( the same issue occurs in Typora too). 

   See this [link](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/edge-still-flashing-white-screen-and-force-dark-theme-visibility/m-p/1609930)

   (I have Dark Reader installed so it flash from white to the black webpage that DarkReader renders but it works well in Vivaldi meaning that Dark Reader isn't the cause of the issue).

    My eyes are too fragile to bear the flash. And I'm a crazy guy who seek every possible way to make my windows dark and easy to stare at all day.

2. It don't have a seperate search bar like Vivaldi. I often want to search the same words in different search engines to get better results. Vivaldi can make this faster.

3. Vivaldi can't press tab in the address bar to search, but it has a nickname feature. Just press g and a space bar and then you can search in google. It's much quicker than tab.

4. I simply don't like the way win10 do it. It is suggesting using Edge everywhere. Did Microsoft forgot the antitrust case about its browser before?

## Other Nice Experience of Vivaldi

I find it a great browser, and perhaps the best browser.

- It support Chrome plugins.

- The settings window is great and I can find it right at the bottom left corner or press Ctrl+F12.

  Also. it's a small window instead of a new tab, meaning that I can set settings without switch tabs back and forth.

- Select some words, and right click it to add it right to the "notes" in Vivaldi with it's web link. 
  
  - Well, we all use Note apps like OneNote or Evernote to get it sync to all the platforms. But the in browser light weight note with some simple click might be useful for some inconsequential stuff.
  
- Show progress inside address bar

- PageUp and PageDown performances seem to be faster than other browsers.

- I often hate that I can't select a word and press Ctrl+F to find the word in Edge. I have to copy and paste it into the search text box. But Vivaldi can do this. I mean yes the first time you search a word, both browsers can do it. But if you search another word by Ctrl + F again, Edge will not change its searching word.

- TBH, I don't care many of it's other unique features, They might be useful but the no-flash-from-white-to-black feature is enough. I'm better off already.

## Disadvantage

- I find no direct UI way to import password and bookmarks from the new Chromium based edge.

  But I did find [this link](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/23989/export-import-passwords-via-csv-vivaldi-1-13-1-14/7) that tells us that we can use a chrome's specific setting url to achieve import passwords through csv.

  Bookmakrs are ok because I don't quite rely on it. I can remember most website urls that I use frequently. And I record other urls in my diary.

  

- No IOS app. Meaning that I can't sync my data on my iPhone. 

- Can't close the last tab to exit the app. When the app is only showing a "start page" tab, I have to click the X button instead of use the shortcut Ctrl + W. Frankly, Alt+F4 is too less convenient.

- Doesn't show up url when loading a new page until it's loaded or after several seconds.

- Built-in Ad-blocker. I find it works on Youtube. However, it works much slower than uBlock Origin. It just wasted my time. 

- Loading speed is slower than Edge and Brave. However, I found that disable "Page Load Progress Bar" will make it faster.

- It still get white flash issue when the first time opening the Start Page in a new tab. Also it's blank page is pure white instead of black.

  

## All of these browsers compared to Firefox

Firefox has a quite advanced web proxy setting feature.

As I remember, the settings UI is also a window in Firefox.

I might switch to Firefox when I need to.

## Brave

It is said that we can make money through Brave?? Also it is said it's faster. I'm going to give it a shot.

- Well, I don't like the absence of a sperate search bar. I also don't like the seperate setting UI tab, without a shortcut key to bring it on.
- But the built-in ad blocker is much faster. Somehow I think it's faster than uBlock
- It seems to have "tab-search" feature as well, and have a Keyword feature which is the same as Vivaldi's nickname feature.
- The icon of a new chrome plugin is not pinned by default. I don't like it.
- It seems to have no flash problem when activating the window after it minimized.Hoever, when starting up, it still have the god damn white flash problem. However, I almost don't close the browser when it got some problem. So it's not that important.
- Has less appearance settings than Vivaldi. I like Vivaldi
- When loading pages in a new tab or reloading a page when click back to it, it starts white. I hate it.



Personally, I think I can use them together. One is quick, the other is user friendly. Personally, I prefer eye-protection rather than quick. This is because when I'm searching stuff, I'm also thinking, so in fact I'm not that in hurry to save 1 second. I can use the loading time to think. But I can't bear the white flash. So I tend to use Vivaldi.



It's a shame that no browser is perfect. If we can put them together like lego we can certainly get a perfect one.



## update: swtched to Brave, because I think I need the money
