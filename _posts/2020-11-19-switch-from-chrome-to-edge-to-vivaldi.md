## Switch from Chrome to Edge, reason:

- Edge seems to be quicker.

## Switch from Edge to Vivaldi, several reasons:

1. It flashes from white to black every time I activte the window, also when starting the app ( the same issue occurs in Typora too). 

   (I have Dark Reader installed so it flash from white to the black webpage that DarkReader renders but it works well in Vivaldi meaning that Dark Reader isn't the cause of the issue).

    My eyes are too fragile to bear the flash. And I'm a crazy guy who seek every possible way to make my windows dark and easy to stare at all day.

2. It don't have a seperate search bar like Vivaldi. I often want to search the same words in different search engines to get better results. Vivaldi can make this faster.

3. Vivaldi can't press tab in the address bar to search, but it has a nickname feature. Just press g and a space bar and then you can search in google. It's much quicker than tab.

4. I simply don't like the way win10 do it. It is suggesting using Edge everywhere. Did Microsoft forgot the antitrust case about its browser before?

## Other Vivaldi's Nice Experience

I find it a greate browser, and perhaps the best browser.

- It support Chrome plugins.
- The settings window is great and I can find it right at the bottom left corner or press Ctrl+F12.
- Select some words, and right click it to add it right to the "notes" in Vivaldi with it's web link. 
  - Well, we all use Note apps like OneNote or Evernote to get it sync to all the platforms. But the in browser light weight note with some simple click might be useful for some inconsequential stuff.
- TBH, I don't care many of it's unique features, The no-flash-from-white-to-black feature is enough.

## Disadvantage

- I find no direct UI way to import password and bookmarks from the new Chromium based edge.

  But I did find [this link](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/23989/export-import-passwords-via-csv-vivaldi-1-13-1-14/7) that tells us that we can use a chrome's specific setting url to achieve import passwords through csv.

  Bookmakrs are ok because I don't quite rely on it. I can remember most website urls that I use frequently. And I record other urls in my diary.

  

- No IOS app. Meaning that I can't sync my data on my iPhone. 

- Can't close the last tab to exit the app. When the app is only showing a "start page" tab, I have to click the X button instead of use the shortcut Ctrl + W. Frankly, Alt+F4 is too less convenient.

## All of these browsers compared to Firefox

Firefox has a quite advanced web proxy setting feature.
