## Switch from Chrome to Edge, reason:

- Edge seems to be quicker.



## Switch from Edge to Vivaldi, several reasons:

1. It flashes from white to black every time I activte the window. (I have Dark Reader installed but it works well in Vivaldi). My eyes are too fragile to bear this.
2. It don't have a seperate search bar like Vivaldi. I often want to search the same words in different search engines to get better results. Vivaldi can make this faster.
3. Vivaldi can't press tab in the address bar to search, but it has a nickname feature. Just press g and a space bar and then you can search in google. It's much quicker than tab.

## Vivaldi Use Experience

I find it a greate browser, and perhaps the best browser.
