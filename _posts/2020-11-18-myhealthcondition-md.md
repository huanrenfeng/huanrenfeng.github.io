My health condtion fluctuates from late October till now. I got a fever several times, and every time I got a fever I took a vitamin B pill. It can make me better for about 24 hours, but if I overdose, say I take another pill after 24 hours, I often got side effects from it. And after all these experience I realized that the B complex pill would never cure me. It just like a pain killer. Once I stop taking it for more than 36 hours, I'll have a fever again.



I don't know what's wrong with me. But I suspect that my immunity is broken somehow so that I could never recover from a simple disease. Or this disease is too harsh. But I doubt it. People around me are all fine but why do me have to be sick?



I can't go to the hospital. One thing is that they will quarantine me no matter what's happening to me. The other thing is that I don't have a health care. Also I don't trust doctors too because I have got sick a lot of times and most doctors can't find a way to treat me. I discovered several effective medicine purely by myself and I have nothing to say to these quacks.

I don't know how long have god left for me. I don't know what does he mean. Why me? What have I done that have to be punished like this?

I'm not fear of death. What I hate is the unknown.

I want to talk more about my pills.

I take many different kinds of pills.The B-complex pill can't ease my headache, so I take pain killers too. But the pain killer has another side affect: it makes me hard to fall asleep. And when that happens, it will drain my vigor and let me feel awful in the next day. 

I have to take another kind of pill to suppress my allergy reaction. Year after year, my allergy situation is getting worse and worse. A year before, I only need to take them when I needed to. But right now, once I stopped taking them, concequences will come very soon. However it only take effects like 5 hours later after I took the pill. It means that it's too late to take the pill after I got the reaction and I have to suffer from it. My reaction includes sneezing constantly, fever, and pain all over my body. In the old days the medicine can control them all, but right now, the pill can't ease my body reaction any more, which means that my allergy condition is getting worse.

I also have some spine problem since I was a kid. I have a kind of medicine for that too. But it's much mild compared to my allergy problem.

I also take other different supplements like Vitamin C, Mineral supplements.
