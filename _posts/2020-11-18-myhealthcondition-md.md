My health condtion fluctuates from late October till now. I got a fever several times, and every time I got a fever I took a vitamin B pill. It can make me better for about 24 hours, but if I overdose, say I take another pill after 24 hours, I often got side effects from it. And after all these experience I realized that the B complex pill would never cure me. It just like a pain killer. Once I stop taking it for more than 36 hours, I'll have a fever again.



I don't know what's wrong with me. But I suspect that my immunity is broken somehow so that I could never recover from a simple disease. Or this disease is too harse. But I doubt it. People around me are all fine but why do me have to be sick?



I can't go to the hospital. One thing is that they will quarantine me no matter what's happening to me. The other thing is that I don't have a health care. Also I don't trust doctors too because I have got sick a lot of times and most doctors can't find a way to treat me. I discovered several effective medicine purely by myself and I have nothing to say to these quacks.

I don't know how long have god left for me. I don't know what does he mean. Why me? What have I done that have to be punished like this?

I'm not fear of death. What I hate is the unknown.
